# **Dynamic Morag Tong Armor**
#### **v. 1.0**
#### ***an OpenMW Lua mod by Rosynant***

## Why this mod?

This is an upgraded version of my [Morag Tong Armor Revisited](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51728) mod. It distributes pieces of the Morag Tong armor (originally by [NazoX9](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44938), improved by me) to all faction members in the game. The armor is also available to the player at several vendors.

My previous mod added the armor pieces to Morag Tong members "by hand" in the CS, which had a drastic impact on compatibility and made any updates tedious and difficult. This one is free of these issues.

## What does it do?

With this mod all Morag Tong members wear the new Morag Tong armor set. NPCs from TR and other mods that belong to the faction will get the armor automatically. You can also purchase all the pieces when you become a member yourself.

### Armor set

It includes brand new:

1. Cuirass (male and female versions)
2. Greaves
3. Boots
4. Gauntlets
5. Pauldrons
6. Skirt.

Morag Tong members will also wear the vanilla:

1. Helmet
2. Robe
3. Gloves

The models were made by NazoX9, I later polished and improved most of them. I also created new icons. The whole set uses original game textures and fits the style of the vanilla pieces very well (only helmet, robe and gloves are present in the game by default).

### Armor stats

Morag Tong Armor is too cool to be barely better than Chitin. Now it has base Armor Rating of 22,
providing slightly more protection than Bonemold Armor. I consider it to be a sweet spot, given how special this armor is, but not making it overpowered. It also makes the armor a viable middle-tier choice for Light Armor users, an option apparently missing in vanilla.

The robe worn by some Morag Tong members in vanilla is given a proper name and has stats in between expensive and extravagant clothes, reflecting its uniqueness. The same applies to the new Morag Tong Skirt and Black Gloves (also appropriately renamed).

### Morag Tong members

For an increased variety armor pieces worn by NPCs depend on their faction rank, so you will see different combinations on different Morag Tong members.

### Getting the armor



## Requirements

- [OpenMW 0.49](https://openmw.org/downloads/) or newer
- Bloodmoon
- Tribunal

## Installation

Install like any other mod for OpenMW. Follow the official guide [here](https://openmw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/modding/mod-install.html). Enable both the plug-in and the scripts in your mod list.

## Compatibility

Should be compatible with anything that does not touch the few Morag Tong-related changes that I made in the CS:

- vanilla pieces (helmet, robe, gloves)
- a few Morag Tong vendor NPCs

Otherwise, there should be no conflicts. Note, however, that if you use something that changes the apparel of Morag Tong members, load this mod afterwards to see this armor on them.

I also kept any changes from -atch for Purists, wherever applicable. The plug-in has been checked and cleand with Enchanted Editor.
